# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions: Insurance Analytics Project Final Report

## Executive Summary

_Summarize the business objectives, main findings, and actionable recommendations in 1-2 paragraphs._

---

## Methodology

- **Data Source:** Historical insurance claim data (Feb 2014 - Aug 2015)
- **Analysis Steps:**
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Hypothesis Testing (A/B tests on risk drivers)
  - Predictive Modeling (claim severity, claim probability, premium optimization)
- **Tools Used:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Jupyter Notebooks

---

## Key EDA Insights

- _Summarize the most important findings from your EDA notebook. Include trends, outliers, and any segmentation opportunities discovered._
- Example:
  - "Claim frequency is highest in Gauteng and lowest in Western Cape."
  - "Certain vehicle makes/models are associated with higher claim amounts."
  - "Outliers in TotalClaims are primarily due to a small number of high-value claims."

## Hypothesis Testing Results & Recommendations

| Hypothesis | Test Used | p-value | Result | Business Recommendation |
|------------|-----------|---------|--------|------------------------|
| No risk differences across provinces | ANOVA |      | Accept/Reject | _E.g., Adjust pricing by province if rejected_ |
| No risk differences between zip codes | ANOVA |      | Accept/Reject | _E.g., Investigate high-risk zip codes_ |
| No margin difference between zip codes | ANOVA |      | Accept/Reject | _E.g., Adjust underwriting or pricing_ |
| No risk difference between Women and Men | t-test |      | Accept/Reject | _E.g., Consider gender in segmentation_ |
